# ✅ Example Q&A

## Example 1

### Question
What is self-attention?

### Answer
Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention, is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence.

## Example 2

### Question
What is clustering in machine learning?

### Answer
Clustering is the unsupervised task of grouping similar instances together. The notion of similarity depends on the structure and distribution of the data.

### Sources
- `ml_book.pdf` — page 120

---

## Example 3

### Question
What is the difference between Xavier and He initialization?

### Answer
Xavier initialization is commonly used for sigmoid and tanh activations to maintain stable gradients, while He initialization is designed for ReLU-based activations and uses larger variance to compensate for inactive neurons.
